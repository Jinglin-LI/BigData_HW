Let's create a social network of users liking each other's social media posts. For every person, we will keep track of their name and age.
Every edge will contain source, destination and an integer indicating the number of times a person liked other's posts.
Below is the code to create the social network:

import org.apache.spark.graphx._
import org.apache.spark.rdd.RDD

val vertexArray = Array(
  (1L, ("Alice", 28)),
  (2L, ("Bob", 27)),
  (3L, ("Charlie", 65)),
  (4L, ("David", 42)),
  (5L, ("Ed", 55)),
  (6L, ("Fran", 50))
  )
val edgeArray = Array(
  Edge(2L, 1L, 7),
  Edge(2L, 4L, 2),
  Edge(3L, 2L, 4),
  Edge(3L, 6L, 3),
  Edge(4L, 1L, 1),
  Edge(5L, 2L, 2),
  Edge(5L, 3L, 8),
  Edge(5L, 6L, 3)
  )
  
 val vertexRDD: RDD[(Long, (String, Int))] = sc.parallelize(vertexArray)
 val edgeRDD: RDD[Edge[Int]] = sc.parallelize(edgeArray)
 val graph: Graph[(String, Int), Int] = Graph(vertexRDD, edgeRDD)
  
  
 1. We would like to create a listing of those people who are at least 30 years old.
 
 
 3. Find the number of triplets in the graph


 4. Create a listing of who likes who's posts
 
 
 5. Now create a listing of those triplete where the number of likes is more than 5
 
 
 6. Display indegrees of each vertex
 
 7. We would like to find the user that follows the most number of people

 
 8. How many people whose posts user 5 likes also like each other's posts.
 Another way to ask this question: how many triangles can you count around user 5
 

 
 9. Find the oldest follower of each user
 
  
10. Find the youngest follower of each user

  
11. Find the youngest person that each person is following

  
12. Find the pagerank of each user and list them in descending order:
